# Overview: Simple explanation and assumptions {#overview}

Density is the number of objects (trees, animals, etc.) per unit area. If a 100-m$^2$ plot contains one tree, the density is 1 tree/100-m$^2$, or 10,000 trees per km$^2$ ( Figure \@ref(fig:density)).  Similarly, if a camera has a field-of-view of 100-m$^2$ and there is always one animal in the field-of-view for the whole time that the camera is operating, the density of that species is 1 animal per 100-m$^2$, or 10,000 animals per km$^2$. It doesn’t matter if the animal is moving around within the field-of-view, as long as it stays in the field-of-view for the whole time. On the other hand, if that camera only has an animal in the field-of-view 1/10,000 of the time that it is operating, there is 1/10,000 animal per 100-m$^2$, or 1 animal per km-$^2$.  If the camera has two animals together for 1/10,000 of the time, this gives 2/10,000 animals per 100-m$^2$, or 2 animals per km-$^2$. This is how we use cameras to calculate density.

<br>

$$Density = \frac{\sum(number~of~individuals~*~time~in~field~of~view)}{area~of~field~of~view~*~total~camera~operating~time}$$
<br>

The units are animal-seconds per area-seconds, which equates to animals per area (i.e. density).

<br>

```{r density, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of density for a tree quadrat and camera surveys.", fig.align="center"}

include_graphics(here("./docs/pics/density.png"))

```

<br>

For a given density of animals, this simple measure is independent of home range sizes or movement rates. If home ranges were twice as big, they would have to overlap twice as much to maintain the same density. Therefore, an individual would be in a particular camera’s field-of-view half as often (because its home range is bigger – it has more other places to be), but there would be twice as many individuals at that camera. If movement rates were twice as fast, an individual would pass by the camera twice as often, but would spend half as much time in the field-of-view (because it is moving faster). For the simple example above, there would be two visits to the camera each occupying 1/20,000 of the time the camera is operating, rather than one visit for 1/10,000 of the time.  The other way of putting this is that only the total animal-time in the field-of-view matters, whether that comes from one long visit by one individual, several short visits by one individual, or several short visits each by a different individual. In all those cases, the density is the same; it is only the home range size and overlap and/or movement rates that are changing.

Two features of cameras require us to do some additional data processing to use this simple density measure: 

  1. **Cameras do not survey fixed areas, unlike quadrats**. The probability of an animal triggering the camera decreases with distance. We therefore have to estimate an *effective detection distance* (EDD) for the cameras, as is done for unlimited-distance point counts for birds or unlimited distance transect surveys. This effective distance can vary for different species, habitat types and time of year. 
  
  2. **Cameras take a series of images at discrete intervals, rather than providing a continuous record of how long an animal is in the field-of-view**. The discrete intervals need to be converted to a continuous measure to show how long the animal was in the field-of-view, accounting for the possibility that a moderately long interval between images might be from an animal present but not moving much, and therefore not triggering the camera, versus an animal that left the field-of-view and returned. The analyses dealing with these complications are outlined below.

There are a number of strong assumptions involved in using this measure to estimate density of a species. A couple big assumptions are: 

  + The cameras are a random or otherwise representative sample of the area. The density estimate applies to the field-of-view of the cameras. To make inferences about a larger region, the cameras need to be surveying a random or representative (e.g., systematic, systematic-random, random stratified) sample of the larger region. In particular, if cameras are intentionally placed in areas where species are more common, such as game trails, then the density estimate only applies to those places, not to a larger region.  
  
  + Animals are not attracted to or repelled by the cameras (or posts used to deploy the cameras, etc).  That also means that they do not spend more or less time in front of the camera because of the presence of the camera. The effect of lures or other attractants needs to be explicitly measured and accounted for. 
  
There are additional assumptions involved in the procedures to estimate effective detection distance, including an assumption that all animals within a certain distance of the camera are detected, and in converting the discrete images into time in field-of-view. These assumptions are discussed below. Because the world is complicated, assumptions are never met perfectly. The important thing is to consider – and, ideally, design auxiliary tests to measure – is whether the violations are serious enough to impact the answer to whatever question(s) the cameras are being used to answer. In many cases, absolute density estimates may not be accurate, but the results can still serve as a useable index of relative density, if assumptions are violated about equally in whatever units are being compared (habitat types, experimental treatments, years for long-term trend, etc).

A final consideration is the sampling distribution of density estimates. Because individual cameras sample tiny areas compared to the home ranges of the species they survey, the resulting sampling distribution can be horrendous – the majority of cameras never detect the species at all (density = 0), a few cameras record the species passing by once or twice for brief periods (low densities), and a very few number of cameras record long durations as the animals forage, rest, or play in front of the camera, or revisit a favourite spot repeatedly (very high densities). Longer duration camera deployments can help smooth out some of that extreme variation, but ultimately large numbers of cameras are required for precise estimates. Appropriate questions, rigorous study designs, and modest expectations are required for camera-based studies.

The following sections give details of components of this density estimate (how ABMI collects the necessary information, results, assumptions, tests – sections 2 to 5), other factors that need to be considered in some designs – sections 6 to 8), and further discussion of the basic assumptions and dealing with the sampling distribution (sections 9 and 10).

# Tagging images and checking accuracy {#tagging}

ABMI cameras have generated about 15 million images so far. Some of these are images taken at fixed time intervals to document the site conditions and verify that the camera was operating. The majority of the images are motion-triggered, and need to have their content identified. We use several automated processes to reduce the number of images that human taggers need to look at:

  1. Neural network “auto-taggers” are trained to recognize images with no animals (“None” images) and images with domestic cows.
  
  2. A two-stage subsampling procedure is used with series of 6 or more images separated by less than a two-minute cut-off: 5 randomly selected images are tagged by humans and used to fill in the rest of the series, unless a native mammal is detected in any of the 5 images, in which case all images in the series are tagged by people.
  
  3. Additional auto-filling rules are used when a substantial number of images in a series are tagged by an auto-tagger, and for images that occur at the start or end of a deployment that are staff setting up cameras.
  
Cut-off scores for the auto-taggers, the subsampling approach and the other rules were all developed using data from millions of images and were set so that they are expected to miss <0.1% of images of native animals.  With these procedures, approximately 15% of the total number of images are tagged by humans.

After all images have been tagged, we do a second species-by-species check of all identified native mammals to look for errors, including in difficult to separate species, such as marten and fisher, or white-tailed and mule deer (and we include categories for unknown deer or other groups).

Finally, we do another test of 5,000 randomly selected images from each of the different processes – auto-tagged None, auto-tagged Cows, filled-in subsampled series, human-tagged None, human-tagged cows, human-tagged native mammals – to assess final accuracy. The automated processes all miss <0.1% of native mammals. Human taggers have a somewhat higher error rate, generally for ambiguous images. These error rates are about 100+ times better than we find for surveys of birds or plants. Details of the tagging processes and the accuracy tests are available in separate documents.

# Native mammal data {#native}

We begin with the entirety of the native mammal image data, collected from all deployments across all years. This includes both on- and off-grid ABMI deployments, as well as supplementary data from other research programs and partners (e.g. Big Grid, WHEC, CMU, etc). At this point, the automated processes described above have been applied and some light pre-processing has been done to clean up the remaining data (details of which can be found in the `src` folder of the Github repository).  

## Sampling coverage

The ABMI samples across the province in a grid-pattern, with sampling points 20-km apart. At each point, four cameras are placed in a square approximately 600-m apart from each other. Figure \@ref(fig:mapdeployments) shows the ABMI's sampling distribution using camera deployments from the years 2015-2018. Note that each deployment (black dot) consists of four cameras. 

```{r mapdeployments, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="ABMI Camera Deployments from 2015-2018.", fig.align="center"}

include_graphics(here("docs/pics/map_deployments.png")) 

```

## Summary statistics

First, let's examine the format the data arrives in from the Wildtrax database after tagging has been completed[^1]. Our dataset consists of a total of `r nrow(df_native_all)` individual image observations, each with information on which camera deployment the image came from, the date and time the image was taken, the species observed, the sex and age class of the animal, and supplemental information for gap and distance analysis (discussed below). 

[^1]: Explain the Wildtrax connection procedure. 

```{r}

glimpse(df_native_all)

```

We summarise the number of images captured by species (common name) between 2013 and 2018 in Figure \@ref(fig:images) for the 11 most common animals.

```{r images, fig.cap="Total images captured to-date (2013-2018).", fig.align="center", out.width="85%"}

# Retrieve the 11 most common species by image count
df_native_top11 <- df_native_all %>%
  filter(!common_name == "Deer") %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarise(images = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(images)) %>%
  top_n(n = 11, wt = images)

df_native_top11 %>%
  mutate(common_name = fct_reorder(as.factor(common_name), images)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = common_name, y = images, fill = common_name)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  # geom_text(aes(label = images, y = images + 15000), size = 3) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Total number of images captured for 11 common species.",
       y = "Images") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 1, angle = 45))

```

<br>

White-tailed and Mule deer account for a large percentage of images taken to-date by remote cameras, following by moose, elk, and black bear. 

Next, we plot the number of images taken of each these species by year (Figure \@ref(fig:imagesperyear)). 

```{r imagesperyear, fig.cap="Number of images taken of each species from 2015-2018", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

# Is this an effective visualization? Maybe not.  

df_native_all %>%
  filter(common_name %in% df_native_top11$common_name,
         Year >= 2015) %>%
  left_join(df_native_top11, by = "common_name") %>%
  mutate(common_name = fct_reorder(common_name, images, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(common_name, Year) %>%
  summarise(images = n()) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = images, fill = common_name)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  facet_wrap(~common_name, scales = "free_y", nrow = 3) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Number of images captured by year for 11 common species.",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of Images") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
        strip.text = element_text(color = "black"))

```

Finally, we can display the occurrences of each of these species at each ABMI site. For the purposes of this map (Figure \@ref(fig:occurrences)), the four camera deployments at each site are grouped together; i.e. if a species was detected at one of the four cameras, the map will display an occurrence at the site.

# Processing data {#processing}

There are a number of processing steps that need to be done to develop the necessary ingredients for density estimation.

```{r params}

# Set analysis parameters for density estimation

# Seasonal start/end dates (julian day):
summer.start.j <- 106 # April 16
summer.end.j <- 288 # October 15

# Reconyx camera field-of-view angle:
cam_fov_ang <- 42

```

## Identify series'

In this step, we package up all the individual images into what we call "series", or a collection of continuous images assumed to be of the same individual animal. A series will always involve the same deployment and species, and images are considered to be part of a series if they are less than 120 seconds apart.

The general procedure is to arrange the `df_native_all` dataframe by deployment, year, species, and the date-time the image was captured. From there, we create new lagged variables of each of those variables in order to identify when a new series began (i.e. an image will have a different deployment and species than the image preceding it, as well as a time difference of greater than 120 seconds). In this step we also flag gaps between images that are greater than 20 seconds but less than 120 seconds (for probabilistic models of whether the animal left, see next section). 

```{r}

# Identify series'

df_series <- df_native_all %>%
  # Transform date_time_taken to POSIXct object
  mutate(date_time_taken = ymd_hms(date_time_taken)) %>%
  # Order observations
  arrange(deployment, Year, common_name, date_time_taken) %>%
  # Identify series
  mutate(series_num = 0,
         # Lagged date_time_taken
         date_time_taken_lag = lag(date_time_taken),
         # Calculate difference in time (seconds) between images
         diff_time = as.numeric(date_time_taken - date_time_taken_lag),
         # Lagged species
         common_name_lag = lag(common_name),
         # Is it a different species? (boolean)
         diff_sp = ifelse(common_name != common_name_lag, TRUE, FALSE),
         # Lagged deployment
         deployment_lag = lag(deployment),
         # Is it a different deployment? (boolean)
         diff_dep = ifelse(deployment != deployment_lag, TRUE, FALSE),
         # Identify series
         diff_series = ifelse(diff_dep == TRUE | diff_sp == TRUE | diff_time > 120,
                              1, 0),
         # Number series
         series_num = c(0, cumsum(diff_series[-1])),
         # Flag gaps that need checking later
         gap_check = ifelse(diff_dep == FALSE & diff_sp == FALSE & (diff_time <= 120 & diff_time >= 20),
                            1, 0),
         # Lagged gap class (to align with gap_check and diff_time)
         gap_class_lag = lag(gap_class)) %>%
  # Clean up species common_name
  filter(!common_name == "Falcons and allies") %>%
  filter(!common_name == "Wolves, Coyotes and Allies") %>%
  mutate(common_name = ifelse(common_name == "Foxes", "Red fox", common_name),
         common_name = ifelse(common_name == "Mule Deer", "Mule deer", common_name))

```

## Develop models for probabilistic gaps

From a pilot study, we determined that if there is a gap of less than 20 seconds between images of the same species at a camera, the animal is almost always still in the view (no evidence of it walking out and returning). Missing the odd time when it leaves the view for less than 20 seconds has little effect on estimates of the total time it is in the field-of-view. At the other end, if there is a gap of >120 seconds between images of the same species, this almost always represented animals leaving and then returning (i.e., the animal is seen walking out of the field-of-view, then walking back in). Gaps of 20-120 seconds are uncertain. These relatively long periods when the animal could be in the field-of-view or not are important when estimating the total durations animals are in the field-of-view, and thus density.

For the 2015 ABMI images, we checked each 20-120 second gap in series' of native mammals for evidence of the animal leaving and returning. For 2016 and 2017 ABMI images, we checked 20-120 second gaps only for less common species where we had low sample size from 2015. We looked at several images on either side of gaps of 20-120 seconds. In each sequence, the animal was designated as having left the field-of-view during the 20-120 second gap if there was clear evidence of it walking out of the field-of-view and then returning (or a different individual entering the field-of-view). If the animal stayed in one location within the field-of-view, or sequential images showed the animal in disconnected places (as often happens with smaller animals), the animal was assumed to have stayed.

From `df_series` we filter for images that were flagged as requiring a gap check (`gap_check`) and had the gaps between images manually classified in 2015 (or later years for some species or studies). Three gap classifications are possible[^2]:

[^2]: There is a fourth gap class, 'N', which is added to flag cases where a None image follows a native mammal image.  

+ **L** - the animal was in the process of leaving the camera field of view ('left');
+ **P** - the animal stayed in the field of view ('present');
+ **U** - 'uncertain' whether the animal stayed or left. 

We then create a new variable, `left`, which indicates whether the animal stayed (gap_class = P) or left (gap_class = L or U).

We can visualize this data in Figure \@ref(fig:gap-raw), which displays the same common species seen before. In general, observations where the animal stayed in the field of view are more closely clustered around the 20 second mark, and observations where the animal left the field of view are more evenly spread across the range of gap lengths.

We used this data to develop models of the probability of a species leaving the field-of-view during a 20-120 second gap as a function of the gap duration. Smoothing splines were fit to the probability of leaving as a function of gap length, using a logit-linked binomial model. This was done separately for each species with enough examined gaps (Figure \@ref(fig:gap-species-model)). In this interactive graphic, the user can double-click on any species in the legend to view its probabilistic curve in isolation.

After examining the resulting curves, species were grouped into 6 “gap groups”: all ungulates except moose, moose, bears, cougars and canids, all other carnivores (mostly mustelids), and all other mammals (small species). Gap probability models were built for each of these groups in this next step, and the results from these models are used in the calculation of total time in front of the camera. 

```{r gap-group-model}

# Gap group models
mod_gapcheck_group <- df_gapcheck %>%
  # Join in gap groups lookup table
  left_join(df_gap_groups, by = "common_name") %>%
  group_by(gap_group) %>%
  nest() %>%
  # Define model for each gap group, and make predictions
  mutate(model = map(.x = data, ~ smooth.spline(x = .$diff_time, y = .$left, df = 3)),
         pred = map(.x = model, ~ predict(., x = 20:120))) %>%
  select(gap_group, pred) %>%
  unnest_wider(pred) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(x,y)) %>%
  rename(diff_time = x, pred = y) %>%
  ungroup()

```

Across all species, there is a 27% chance that the species left when the gap was only 20 seconds long. That implies that they may also have left in slightly shorter gaps, where we assume they all stayed. However, it makes little difference to the total duration to miss a few shorter gaps where the animals left (i.e., to add that extra little bit of time in), especially because we add time to the start and end of a series (next section). At the other end, there was evidence that animals left in about 70% of the 120 second gaps.  Snowshoe hares, porcupines and black bears lowered that average. The first two are small mammals that trigger the camera erratically, making it hard to figure out which way they are moving, so that they generally don’t present definitive evidence of leaving the field-of-view and returning. Bears, and wolves to a lesser extent, often lie/loll around, mainly at lured deployments, and could go for relatively long periods without triggering the camera. Missing long periods when bears are present but not moving would lead to underestimates of their densities. For trend estimates and habitat modeling, we would have to assume that the prevalence of those misses does not change over time or by habitat type. The other species had higher leaving rates for long gaps, so that we are probably not too inaccurate to assume that they left during any gap greater than 120 seconds.

Ideally, each gap between images would be checked to see if the animal left or not. However, the process of checking each gap is time-consuming. When we have direct information on gap-leaving, we define a series as any set of images separated by less than 120 seconds, unless the animal was observed to leave the field-of-view (in gaps of 20-120 seconds that were checked) (illustrated in \@ref(fig:gap-illustration)). If it did leave in a gap, then the series ends at the preceding image, and a new series starts when the animal (or a different individual) returns in the subsequent image. The species is in the field-of-view from the first to the last image in the field-of-view (plus end buffers; next sub-section).

When we haven’t examined 20-120 second gaps, a series is all images separated by <120 seconds. However, we then use the above models of gap-leaving probabilities to prorate the 20-120 second gaps for the probability that the species left for a gap of that length. Instead of the full 20-120 second gap length, we only add the duration of the gap x (1 – probability of leaving) to the total series length (illustrated in \@ref(fig:gap-illustration), bottom). For example, if there were 4 images separated by 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 60 seconds and 10 seconds, and the model for that species showed a 40% chance that it left in a gap of 60 seconds, then the total time in the field-of-view for that series is 10 + 5 + 60 x (1 - 0.4) + 10 = 61 seconds.  (And, if there were an average of 1.25 individuals in those 4 images, the total animal-seconds would be 1.25 x 61 = 76.25 animal-seconds). 

Finally, we must consider the time before the first image and after the last image of a series, and time to allocate to single-image series'. We estimate that by calculating the average time between images in all series, separately by species (Table 1). This is typically 4-7 seconds for larger species and somewhat longer for small species. This time is added to the duration of each series, including to single-image series, which would otherwise have a duration of 0 seconds (striped sections in \@ref(fig:gap-illustration). The assumption is that the animal is in the field-of-view for half the average inter-photo time before the first image, and after the last image. (Although animals often appear to be further into the field-of-view when the first image is taken, and nearer the edge when the final one is taken, presumably reflecting a lag-time in the motion-detector – the assumption is that this averages to the average interval within series). When we have 20-120 second gaps that are using the probabilistic gap-leaving model, we add this extra time on the start and end of the whole series in the normal way, and we also added this time multiplied by the probability of leaving for each 20-120 second gap, to account for the cases where the animal would have left the field-of-view in those 20-120 second gaps and hence created another series (bottom of \@ref(fig:gap-illustration)). 

```{r gap-illustration, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of how sequential individual images are converted to series, and how the species' total time in the field-of-view is calculated for each series, when we have directly examined gaps of 20-120 seconds (top) or not examined them and used probabilistic model instead (bottom).", fig.align="center"}

include_graphics(here("./docs/pics/gap_illustration.png"))

```

<br>

In the next step, we re-run series numbering to include the checked gap information and flag gaps that will need probabilistic time assignment. We also calculate the average time between images in a series by species (presented in Table \@ref(tab:tbi)).

```{r tbi, fig.cap=""}

df_series_2 <- df_series %>%
  mutate(gap_class_lag = replace_na(gap_class_lag, "")) %>%
  mutate(diff_series_2 = 
           ifelse(diff_sp == TRUE | 
                  diff_dep == TRUE | 
                  diff_time > 120 | 
                  (gap_class_lag == "L" | gap_class_lag == "N"),
                  1, 0)) %>%
  # Recalculate series numbering
  mutate(series_num = c(0, cumsum(diff_series_2[-1]))) %>%
  # Flag gaps that need probabilistic time assignment
  mutate(prob_gap = 
           ifelse(gap_check == 1 &
                  (gap_class_lag == "" | gap_class_lag == "U"),
                  1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(prob_gap = replace_na(prob_gap, 0))

# Calculate time between images (tbi), by species.
df_tbi <- df_series_2 %>%
  mutate(series_num_lag = lag(series_num)) %>%
  filter(series_num == series_num_lag) %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarise(time_btwn_photos = round(mean(diff_time), digits = 2),
            sample_size = n())

# Create table
df_tbi %>%
  top_n(20, wt = sample_size) %>%
  arrange(desc(sample_size)) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Species", "Average time", "Sample size"),
        caption = "Average time between images within a series, by species.",
        align = c("l", "r", "r"))

```

<br> 

Next, for unclassified 20-120 second gaps, we adjust for the probability of having left by using the predicted probabilistic time assignment from the above models. The appropriate gap group model is used for each species. A new variable, `diff_time_adj`, is calculated.  

```{r}

# Use gap group model to include probabilistic time assignment

df_series_3 <- df_series_2 %>%
  # Join in gap group lookup table
  left_join(df_gap_groups, by = "common_name") %>%
  # Join in probabilistic gap information
  left_join(mod_gapcheck_group, by = c("gap_group", "diff_time")) %>%
  mutate(pred = replace_na(pred, 1),
         diff_time_adj = round(ifelse(prob_gap == 1, 
                               diff_time * (1 - pred), diff_time), 
                               digits = 2))

```

## Calculate total time in front of camera

Using the difference in time between each image that has been adjusted for the probability of leaving (when gaps are between 20 and 120 second), we then proceed to calculate the total time for each series, first for multi-image series' and then single image series'.

```{r}

# Time for multiple-image series (tfs)
df_tfs_1 <- df_series_3 %>%
  # First we have to remove the first image (w/ large diff_time_adj).
  mutate(series_num_lag = lag(series_num)) %>%
  filter(series_num_lag == series_num) %>%
  group_by(series_num) %>%
  # Calculate number of images in each series, then the total time.
  summarise(count = n(),
            total_time = sum(diff_time_adj))

# Time for single-image series'
df_tfs_2 <- df_series_3 %>%
  mutate(series_num_lag = lag(series_num)) %>%
  group_by(series_num) %>%
  # Count the number of photos in each series.
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  # Filter for series' with only one photo.
  filter(count == 1) %>%
  # For now, total time in the field of view is 0.
  mutate(total_time = 0) %>%
  # Add multi-photo series' df back in.
  bind_rows(df_tfs_1) %>%
  arrange(series_num)

# There are a total of 92,418 series.

```

<br> 

The next step is to add time before the first photo and after the last photo, which is assumed to be the average of that species time between images (`df_tbi`). For single image series, this becomes the entire length of time. The dataframe created below, `df_tfs_final`, contains fields for the series number, the species, the number of images, and the total (adjusted) time that the animal was captured on camera.  

```{r}

# Bring in tbi_all, which includes data from 2019 CMU
df_tbi_all <- read_csv(paste0(root, "processed/time-btwn-photos/tbi-all_2020-04-17.csv"))

# Calculate total time in front of camera, including time before the first and after the last image.

df_tfs_final <- df_series_3 %>%
  # Add tbi information
  left_join(df_tbi_all, by = "common_name") %>%
  select(series_num, common_name, time_btwn_photos) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  # Join to previous time calculation (both single- and multiple series) 
  left_join(df_tfs_2, by = "series_num") %>%
  mutate(series_total_time = total_time + time_btwn_photos) %>%
  select(series_num, common_name, count, series_total_time)
  
```

<br>

Finally, we account for the number of individuals in the series. The number of individuals of each species visible in each image are simply counted. Juveniles – often in company of their mothers – are counted and therefore included in the density estimates. We note age class of each animal so that we could exclude non-adults if we wanted for some analysis (assuming we are confident in that designation in all images). Distant animals are sometimes captured in images triggered by an individual closer to the camera. We count all individuals, because it is not clear how we would know an individual was too distant to trigger the camera. To be consistent, when we are collecting data on animals in front of or behind the 5m pole, we also include all individuals, even distant individuals when a closer animal clearly triggered the image. Distant animals therefore increase the effective detection distance, although only to the same extent as any animal beyond the 5m pole.

Series of images showing continuous presence of a species in front of the camera (defined in the next subsection) can have different numbers of individuals. Because the density measure only requires total animal-seconds – i.e., it doesn’t matter which individual(s) is/are in front of the camera at any one time – we simply take the average number of individuals in each photograph in the series. A series with 1, 1, 2 and 1 individual in its four photos would have 1.25 individuals present on average. This may produce a slight upward bias in the density index, because it is possible that the camera would be triggered more often when there are more individuals in front of the camera (because one individual is more likely to be moving, and there is more likely to be an individual closer to the camera’s motion detectors). More individuals may therefore be associated with shorter intervals between images than the average for the series. A more precise approach might be to do a time-weighted average number of individuals in the series, where the time for each image is the interval from the mid-point between it and the previous image, and the mid-point with the subsequent image. This more complicated time-weighted average has not yet been implemented at ABMI, because it probably makes little difference to the estimate, even when variable numbers of individuals are present in a series.

```{r}

# Count number of animals in each series, and compute average across a series

df_n_ani <- df_series_3 %>%
  mutate(number_individuals = replace_na(number_individuals, 1),
         # Assume VNA is 1
         number_individuals = as.numeric(ifelse(number_individuals == "VNA", 1, number_individuals))) %>%
  group_by(series_num) %>%
  # Calculate number of images in each series, then the average number of individuals per series.
  summarise(n_photos = n(),
            mean_animals = mean(number_individuals))
  
```

Using this information we will later be able to calculate the total 'animal-unit-seconds' for each series.

```{r}

df_series_4 <- df_series_3 %>%
  group_by(series_num) %>%
  arrange(date_time_taken) %>%
  # Use the first image of each series.
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
  left_join(df_n_ani, by = "series_num") %>%
  left_join(df_tfs_final, by = c("series_num", "common_name")) %>%
  mutate(DeploymentYear = paste(deployment, Year, sep = "_"),
         series_total_time = mean_animals * series_total_time) %>%
  select(DeploymentYear, deployment, year = Year, date_time_taken, series_num, 
         n_photos, common_name, sex, age_class, mean_animals, series_total_time) %>%
  ungroup()

```

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# Remove mammal records after final end or in intermediate end-start periods

# Cameras with multiple deployment periods:
df_cam_multper <- df_cam_time_lure %>%
  group_by(DeploymentYear) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(n > 1)

# OK, the problem we have is tracking: i) cameras w/ multiple deployment periods (on purpose).
# ii) cameras w/ multiple deployment periods (accidentally)
# iii) cameras that recored no images of native mammals. 

test <- df_series_4 %>%
  left_join(df_cam_time, by = "DeploymentYear") %>%
  mutate(valid = ifelse((date_time_taken >= StartTime | date_time_taken <= EndTime), TRUE, FALSE))

```

## Time cameras are operating {#time}

The next ingredient in the density calculation is accounting for the total time that the camera deployments are operating. For many cameras, the total operating time is simply the time from just after the initial set-up to just before the final collection. However, some cameras fail before they are picked up, most often because they run out of memory or battery power after taking many pictures of cows, vegetation or occasionally perching birds. Other cameras fail because they fall over or are knocked over by cows. We use specific criteria for determining when a camera is too displaced to use – if the 5m pole is no longer in the image field, or the camera is tilted >30° from horizontal. Some of those may be re-established either during a mid-season visit or simply when the camera tilts back (e.g. if it is on a post that cows lean on), leading to a gap in operating time for the camera.

The time that each ABMI camera was operating are illustrated in the plots below. Many off-grid cameras, which target specific habitat types to improve habitat models or address other specific questions, or non-ABMI studies incorporated into the ABMI database, are set out at different times on-grid cameras. Recent years have included some cameras that were deployed in the fall and left out through the winter and following summer. Variation in start and end dates has increased over the four years, due to operational logistics (crew availability and site access). Cameras in the south-central part of the province were more likely to have short operating times because of cows. Besides creating different total operating times that need to be included in the density estimates, the varying deployment periods interact with seasonal variation in detectability of different species, which we need to address in the analysis (section **UPDATE**).

# Effective detection distances of cameras

One option to define the area surveyed by cameras is to define a fixed maximum distance, using a pole or other marker at 5m or 10m or whatever is appropriate.  Animals beyond that distance are not counted.  The assumption, which should be tested, is that all target species are detected if they are within that distance.  The downside of this simple approach is that it excludes data from animals detected in the potentially long tail of greater distances where they are partially detectable.

The ABMI uses all images (unlimited distance), with a procedure to estimate the effective detection distance of cameras. “**Effective detection distance**” is the fixed distance that would give the same number of detections as observed if all animals up to that distance were perfectly detectable and none were detectable further away. This approach is used for any point counts or transects with unlimited distances or with distance bands beyond the distance of perfect detectability. In the ABMI protocol, we place a prominently coloured pole 5m from the camera. All native mammals are recorded as being closer than the pole or farther than the pole, with additional categories for animals that are uncertain (near 5m but not directly in line with the pole), investigating the pole, or investigating the camera. Simple geometry gives the effective detection distance from the proportion of locations that are <5m away versus >5m (excluding the uncertain and investigating images): 

$$EDD~(m) = \frac{5}{sqrt(1-p_{>5m})}$$

where *p* is the proportion of images with the species greater than 5-m away.  

The area surveyed by a camera is:

$$Surveyed~Area~(m^2)~=~\frac{(π~*~EDD^2~*~angle)}{360}$$ 

where *angle* is the angle of the camera’s field-of-view in degrees (42° for the Reconyx cameras that the ABMI uses). This parameter has been set in the code chunk at the beginning of the document, and can be easily changed if new cameras are adopted.

First we prepare the data we will use to develop the effective detection distance models. We use the subset of the data that has had animals in images manually tagged as either at, behind, or in front of the pole (`distance` variable in `df_native_all`). We also limit the data to non-lured deployments. Next, we retrieve the vegetation and human footprint information for each deployment.   

```{r}

# Prepare subset of data for effective detection distance (EDD) modeling

df_distance <- df_native_all %>%
  # Clean up "NA" characters (confusing) - replace with "X"
  mutate(distance = str_replace_all(distance, "NA", "X"),
         distance = str_replace_all(distance, "NA, NA", "X, X"),
         distance = str_replace_all(distance, "NA, NA, NA", "X, X, X")) %>%
  # Make columns of number of individuals at each pole position
  mutate(PoleAt = str_count(distance, "A"),
         PoleBehind = str_count(distance, "B"),
         PoleFront = str_count(distance, "F"),
         PoleIC = str_count(distance, "IC"),
         PoleIP = str_count(distance, "IP"),
         PoleNA = str_count(distance, "X")) %>%
  select(deployment:common_name, sex, age_class, number_individuals, distance:PoleNA) %>%
  filter(!is.na(distance)) %>%
  # Join in lure information
  left_join(df_cam_lure, by = c("deployment", "Year" = "year")) %>%
  # Create variable for Julian date
  mutate(Julian = as.numeric(format(ymd_hms(date_time_taken), "%j"))) %>%
  # Filter out lured deployments - only use unlured for detection distance models.
  filter(Lure == "n")

# Retrieve vegetation and human footprint information for each deployment
df_distance_veghf <- df_veghf_detdist %>%
  select(deployment, year, DeploymentYear, VegForDetectionDistance) %>%
  # Get rid of WetShrub - not used for modeling.
  mutate(VegHF = ifelse(VegForDetectionDistance == "WetShrub", 
                        "Shrub", VegForDetectionDistance)) %>%
  select(-VegForDetectionDistance) %>%
  # Join to distance information.
  right_join(df_distance, by = c("deployment", "year" = "Year")) %>%
  mutate(date_time_taken = ymd_hms(date_time_taken)) %>%
  # Join in EDD species grouping lookup
  left_join(df_dist_groups, by = "common_name") %>%
  # Join alternative VegHF categories to try in the modeling
  left_join(df_veg_lookup, by = "VegHF")

```

Detection distances are expected to differ for different species, by habitat types and possibly by season (e.g., on snowpacks versus in summer shrubs). We therefore used the results to develop detection-distance models for eleven species groups and eight broad habitat types: deciduous forest, upland conifer forest, upland grass, shrub, lowland forest, wet grass, water and human footprint.  BIC-based model selection examined seven models with those habitat types grouped into broader categories, and seven more that added a factor for season (winter = October 15 – April 14, summer = April 15 – October 14).

The next step is to create the combined habitat types, each of which will be tried in the model selection process. 

Next, we develop the detection distance models.

df_edd_bic <- mod_edd %>%

Make some plots:

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Calculate Effective Detection Distances

We want detection distances by species group x deployment x season x veghf type, based on the models we built previously.

"Effective detection distance" is the fixed distance that would give the same number of detections as observed if all animals up to that distance were perfectly detectable and none were detectable further away. 

# Append EDD information to series data

First, tidy things up:

```{r}

df_cam_lure <- df_cam_lure %>%
  mutate(DeploymentYear = paste(deployment, year, sep = "_"))

# Calculate total duration spent on camera by deployment, year, and species:
df_series_5 <- df_series_4 %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Calculate Julian day and season of each series
  mutate(julian = as.numeric(format(date_time_taken, "%j")),
         season = ifelse(julian >= summer.start.j & julian <= summer.end.j,
                         "Summer",
                         "Winter")) %>%
  mutate_at(c("DeploymentYear", "common_name", "season"), factor) %>%
  # Important to add .drop = F argument in group_by so all combinations are preserved.
  group_by(DeploymentYear, common_name, season, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(total_duration = sum(series_total_time)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate_if(is.factor, as.character) %>%
  # Join operating days and lure status
  left_join(df_tbd_summary, by = "DeploymentYear") %>%
  left_join(df_cam_lure, by = "DeploymentYear")
  # ^Note: Missing info from deployments w/o any images of native mammals.

# Character vector of all native species (43 in total)
chr_species <- as.character(sort(unique(df_series_5$common_name)))

# Add deployments w/o any images of native mammals
df_series_nonative <- df_tbd_summary %>%
  # Preserve only those Deployment-Years w/o images of native mammals.
  anti_join(df_series_5, by = "DeploymentYear") %>% # 519 Deployment-Years
  # Expand to include all combinations of DeploymentYear, Season, and Species.
  expand(DeploymentYear, season = c("Winter", "Summer"), common_name = chr_species) %>%
  # Join in operating days.
  left_join(df_tbd_summary, by = "DeploymentYear") %>%
  # Total_Duration is 0 because these species weren't seen.
  mutate(total_duration = 0) %>%
  # Join in lure status.
  left_join(df_cam_lure, by = "DeploymentYear")

# Bind togther the two df's of series (w/ and w/o native mammals)
df_series_full <- df_series_5 %>%
  bind_rows(df_series_nonative) %>%
  arrange(DeploymentYear, common_name, season) %>%
  # Combine total.summer and total.winter into `seasonal` (Season already specified)
  mutate(seasonal = ifelse(season == "Summer", total.summer, total.winter)) %>%
  select(DeploymentYear:season, total, seasonal, Lure, total_duration)

```

Now, we can append EDD information:

```{r}

# Load detection distance modeling from above
load(paste0(root,"processed/detection-distance/predictions/Detection distances by site species and season.rData"))

# Detection distance for each DeploymentYear, SpeciesGroup, and Season combination, tidied.
df_detdist <- dd %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "DeploymentYear") %>%
  gather(key = "SpGroupSeason", value = "detdist", Bear.Summer:`Bighorn sheep.Winter`) %>%
  mutate(SpGroupSeason = str_replace_all(SpGroupSeason, "[//(//)// ]", "")) %>%
  # Create two new columns: Detection Distance Group and Season, sep by "."
  separate(SpGroupSeason, into = c("detdistgroup", "season")) %>%
  mutate(detdistgroup = str_replace(detdistgroup, "wapiti", ""))

# Join detection distance information to df_series_full.
# Now contains all the ingredients to calculate density at each deployment.
df_dens_ing <- df_series_full %>%
  left_join(df_dist_groups, by = "common_name") %>%
  rename(detdistgroup = dist_group) %>%
  mutate(detdistgroup = ifelse(detdistgroup == "Bighorn sheep", "Bighornsheep", detdistgroup),
         detdistgroup = ifelse(detdistgroup == "Mule deer", "Muledeer", detdistgroup)) %>%
  left_join(df_detdist, by = c("DeploymentYear", "season", "detdistgroup")) %>%
  # ^ Missing some detdist info ... which I traced back to missing veghf info.
  # Something to look into.
  select(DeploymentYear, common_name, detdistgroup, season, detdist, everything())

```

Finally, we can calculate density:

```{r}

# Calculating density

df_density <- df_dens_ing %>%
  # Calculate effort per site, in 100-m^2 * days
  mutate(effort = seasonal * (detdist^2 * pi * (cam_fov_ang/360)) / 100,
  # Calculate seconds (s) of animal presence per effort
         cpue = total_duration / effort,
  # Convert to per km^2
         cpue_km2 = cpue / 60 / 60 / 24 * 10000)

```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Update master density file

date <- Sys.Date()

write_csv(df_density, paste0(root, "processed/density/density-all_", date, ".csv"))

```


# Sampling distribution of species density

The distributions of density estimates of species at deployments are extremely skewed, with a large majority of deployments having none of a species, some deployments having low densities (one or a few individuals passing by) while a few have very high values (one or more individuals spending long periods in front of a particular camera) (Figure \@ref(fig:dens-est-dist)). Such distributions require large sample sizes to obtain precise estimates – for example, for yearly changes in density in a region or to use for estimating abundances in different habitat types. Ecologists’ intuitive experience with adequate sample sizes may be very misleading with these kinds of distributions. Pilot studies and formal analysis of expected precision are recommended for large projects.

```{r dens-est-dist, fig.cap="Distribution of density estimates across all deployments.", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

df_density %>%
  filter(common_name %in% df_native_top11$common_name) %>%
  left_join(df_native_top11, by = "common_name") %>%
  mutate(common_name = fct_reorder(factor(common_name), images, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cpue_km2, fill = common_name)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,250)) +
    #scale_y_log10() +
    labs(x = expression(Density~(individuals~per~km^2)),
         y = "Number of Deployments",
         title = "Distribution in estimated density among camera deployments for 11 common\nspecies.") +
    facet_wrap(~ common_name, scales = "free") +
    theme_light() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          strip.text = element_text(color = "black"))

```

<br> 

For habitat modeling, we find that the density estimates are best treated as a compound distribution of presence/absence – modeling how the 0 records differ from the non-0 records – and of abundance where the species is present – explaining variation in abundance where the species was recorded. We model presence/absence with the typical logit-linked binomial model, and the abundance-given-presence distribution with a log-normal distribution, which fits most of the species’ distributions reasonably well (Figure \@ref(fig:dens-agp-log)). This compound distribution is the same as a zero-inflated log-normal distribution, but explicitly treating the two components separately allows more flexible modeling and critical examination of each component.

```{r dens-agp-log, fig.cap="Distribution of log-transformed presence (non-0) densities.", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

df_density %>%
  filter(common_name %in% df_native_top11$common_name) %>%
  left_join(df_native_top11, by = "common_name") %>%
  mutate(common_name = fct_reorder(factor(common_name), images, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  # Filter out deployments with density of 0
  filter(cpue_km2 > 0) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cpue_km2, fill = common_name)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1)) +
    labs(x = expression(Density~(individuals~per~km^2)),
         y = "Number of Deployments",
         title = "Log-normal distribution of density using only presence records for 11 common\nspecies.") +
    facet_wrap(~ common_name, scales = "free") +
    theme_light() +
    theme(legend.position = "blank",
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          strip.text = element_text(color = "black"))

```

# Assumptions of the camera density index

There are a number of strong assumptions involved in using this measure to give absolute density of a species:

+ **Assumption 1: The cameras are a random or otherwise representative sample of the area.** As mentioned in the first section, density is calculated for the area in the fields-of-view of the cameras. To make inferences about density over a larger region, those fields-of-view need to represent the larger region (as is the case for any sampling). This means that cameras are not intentionally put along trails or other features that attract animals. Unfortunately, it also means that cameras should be placed in micro-habitats randomly. This is not possible logistically, because the cameras need some open space in front of them. 

    This practical limitation on camera micro-locations creates problems for interpreting habitat models when habitat types differ in amount of suitably open micro-habitats, if animals either favour or avoid those more open habitats. We are really surveying the use of suitably open micro-habitats within larger habitat types. Micro-habitat selectivity may also create uncertainty in trend, if there are substantial changes in habitat types and the amount of suitable open micro-habitats. Violations of this assumption do not intuitively seem like major potential sources of bias, but it isn’t clear how we would evaluate their effect rigorously.
    
    A more pervasive problem in the south of the province is that we cannot deploy cameras in active cultivated areas, so we use adjacent fence lines, leave strips or woodlot edges. Several species clearly favour those areas. This complicates interpretation of habitat use and trend in extensively cultivated regions, particularly as amount of those edge features changes over time. We would ideally be treating our design as a stratified sample, but we do not have the resources to estimate the areas of the strata we are sampling non-proportionally (or even to define them well) – i.e., we do not know the areas represented by the types of fence lines, woodlots, etc. that can accommodate cameras, and we do not track how those change over time. Interpreting trends from cameras in the south will require more substantive assumptions.

    Cameras could potentially be deployed along game trails, if the design also included some cameras off of these trails, and the results were analysed as a stratified sample of the region. The difficulty again is in determining the area of the “game trail” and “not game trail” strata for whatever units the study is comparing (habitat types, years if the goal is to measure population change).  Extremely detailed ecological information would be needed to know what constitutes a game trail – e.g., the first seismic line put into a forested area versus the hundredth, linear features in open areas, what happens if a natural game trail is clearcut or burned, etc.?

+ **Assumption 2: Animals are not attracted to or repelled by the cameras, and they do not change their behaviour (time spent in front of the camera) because of the cameras.** This is clearly not true for some species, such as bears and moose that regularly investigate the camera and the pole we use to measure detection distance, even when the deployment does not have a lure. It is also violated when cameras are deployed in winter and animals follow the snowshoe tracks in front of the camera, which is frequently seen in the days after winter deployments. These effects increase density estimates. For habitat models or trend that only need relative density, we will have to assume that these effects do not vary substantially by habitat type or between years. Because we have images, we could measure whether species spend different amounts of time investigating the camera or unlured poles in different habitats and whether that changes over time. We could then potentially correct for the biasing effects in habitat models or trend estimates. We have not yet tried that to see how well it works.

+ **Assumption 3: The method to estimate detection distances in different habitats assumes that the animal is certain to be detected within the 5m band.**  Some smaller animals can pass right in front of the camera undetected. This is a concern even using relative abundance for habitat models, if there is substantially higher non-detection in some habitat types, such as shrubby areas or habitats with abundant downed wood. It could also be a concern for trend, if there are large habitat changes that affect detectability near the camera. The assumption seems to be good for animals the size of coyotes or larger, but we only have a small trial that tested that.

+ **Assumption 4: If camera deployment dates are not the same everywhere or standardized to a common period, the method also assumes that there is no major seasonal variation in detectability of a species.** In other words, if the previous 3 assumptions are violated, those violations do not differ by time of year. The best approach is to ensure that cameras are deployed at the same time, or at least that they are all operating for a useably long common set of dates. Alternatively, we will need to find ways to adjust for some cameras (potentially in different habitats or years) sampling more at seasons when a species is more or less detectable.

+ **Assumption 5: The presence of an animal does not reduce the camera operating time.** This assumption is unfortunately violated fairly often when animals, mainly bears, disable cameras. In addition to the extra time in front of the camera that this behaviour produces (violating assumption 2), this also reduces the operating time of the camera, including for all future times when the animal would not be present. Both effects bias density estimates of the camera-destroying species upwards. The bias can be very large when bears disable cameras shortly after deployment. We use a minimum cut-off of 10 operating days to reduce the extreme problems, but we still have cameras that are destroyed shortly after that cut-off that produce very high density estimates. We could omit the last series for an animal that disables a camera, but there are other problems with that solution - it would bias estimates downwards since it removes an animal that would probably have been detected anyway, and there are also often several series of the species in the hours or days(s) before the camera is disabled, which would require a set of timing rules to be developed.

    Calibration of cameras, as technology changes or existing cameras age, is discussed separately (section 8), but is anticipated to require serious effort. Lures, which violate assumption 2, can be accommodated if there is a rigorous design that allows their effects to be estimated (section 7). For both of these corrections, it is important to remember that any uncertainty in the correction factor becomes uncertainty in the main scientific questions the cameras are meant to address. An imprecise correction for changing technology over time, for example, would add directly to the imprecision of any trend estimates. There is no point in putting in the sampling effort needed for a precise trend estimate if the effort is not put in to get a correspondingly precise calibration coefficient when technology changes.
